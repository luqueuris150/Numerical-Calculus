# Numerical-Calculus
A bunch of codes developed as Homework and Exams for the subject of Numerical Calculus. Here one can find Newton's method, some Interpolations (by Lagrange multipliers among others), error evaluation, some applications (for the Pendulum at high angles) and even some challenges solved during class.
